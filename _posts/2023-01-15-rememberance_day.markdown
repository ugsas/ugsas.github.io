Remembrance Day is an important day of commemoration for those who have served in the armed forces. It is a day to honour and remember the sacrifices made by military personnel, as well as to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers who have given their lives in service to their country. People around the world take time to reflect on the bravery and selflessness of those who have served, and to express gratitude for their service and sacrifice. It serves as a reminder of the importance of peace and the sacrifices made to defend it, and serves as an opportunity to recognize and honour the service of military personnel, past and present.

In Glasgow, UGSAS took part in the Glasgow University Remembrance Day parade alongside our colleagues from the University Royal Navy Unit (URNU) and the Glasgow University Officer Training Corps (GUOTC). The day consisted of a service in the University Chapel followed by a march with all 3 services paying compliments to Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal of Glasgow University.
