Welcome to our APOs Q and A page! We're putting our fearless leaders in the hot seat and grilling them with all the questions you've been dying to know the answers to. ||| ![APOs](/img/apos.jpg){:width="100%"}

#### APO Magnus Tait

Q: What has been your most memorable experience on UGSAS so far?

A: My most memorable experience on UGSAS has to be skiing in the French alps. I had a great time and made loads of new friends. Although catching up on the uni work wasn’t very fun.

Q: How do you stay up to date on current affairs, aviation, military policies and procedures, etc.?

A: Some of my top sources for news are the BBC Global News Podcast, Reuters, and Forces News.

Q: If you were stranded on a deserted island and could only bring one other person, who would it be and why?

A: I’d bring Bear Grylls, then sit back and relax as he gets to work.

#### APO Euan Bremner

Q: How do you balance your academic studies with your responsibilities as an APO?

A: By dropping engineering and becoming an historian - coincidentally also beneficial to one's sanity.

Q: What are your long-term goals as an Acting Pilot Officer and how do you plan on achieving them?

A: I'm looking forward to helping the new course get into flying and see them progress through the EFT/AEF syllabus. Hopefully using our shiny new emulator kit and some decent deployed camps (RAF Lossiemouth, got room for a few wee Tutors?)

Q: If you could fly any aircraft in history, what would it be and why?

A: Nimrod - It was good craic, apparently.

#### APO Esther Smith (Senior Student)

Q: What skills do you think are important for an APO to possess?

A: I think a big part of being an APO is being able to work really well as part of a team, both within the SLT and the Squadron as a whole. As well as showing leadership, you need to be able to support and follow.

Q: How do you motivate your Officer Cadets to work together and achieve their goals?

A: I always try to be supportive and offer help or advice where I can, but also by just trying to be enthusiastic about their interests and goals.

Q: If you could be any character from a movie or TV show, who would you be and why?

A: Probably Elsa from Frozen. Mainly because then I’d like the cold and wouldn't feel so bad about not being able to afford to turn my heating on. Plus owning a big castle would be nice.
