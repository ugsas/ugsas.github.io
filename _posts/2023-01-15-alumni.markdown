Once a part of UGSAS, always a part of UGSAS! Recently, we got in touch with some of our alumni to find out what they have been up to lately, and some of their favourite UGSAS memories. It's good to know that the Squadron really doesn't change very much!

### Ken Thomson (1970s)

#### What are you doing now?

I'm a retired airline captain. I served 12 years in the RAF properly and my last tour was as a fast jet instructor at Valley. I now work part time as a volunteer guide at the National Museum of Flight and in my daughter's house renovation business.

#### How has UGSAS helped your career?

It helped me into a flying career but more than that it gave me that sticking power to see a job done. The "never give up" approach to life.

#### What is your best UGSAS story?

I think I was the longest haired (now all gone) male to represent the Air Force at sport. I remember an AVM being aghast in the Officers' Mess at RAF Mountbatten. As a unit we got kicked out of the Mess at Marham and had to eat in a section for us in the Airmens' Mess. Partly because we hooked up the Mess tannoy to UGSAS FM and partly for breaking dress regulations. Somebody had been told off for not wearing a tie and another for not wearing shoes. My mate wore both and got us thrown out. Mind you he was only wearing a tie and shoes and nothing else.

#### Do you have any advice for current members?

The only advice I could possibly pass on is to do what you have a passion for and enjoy. Do it with 100% commitment and see it through to the end.

### Mark Faulds (1980s)

#### What are you doing now?

I'm now the lead pilot instructor for Boeing Defence UK on the Poseidon at RAF Lossiemouth.

#### How has UGSAS helped your career?

UGSAS certainly helped me join the RAF. I was accepted to join the RAF after my time on UGSAS - I did 31 years in the RAF.

#### Do you have any advice for current members?

Just believe that you can succeed. Put in the work and dreams come true.

### Stuart Roxburgh (Student: 1980s; Boss: 2015-18)

#### What are you doing now?

I'm Flt Cdr Trg and a QFI on No 201 Sqn - the Poseidon OCU.

#### How has UGSAS helped your career?

UGSAS prepared me for Fg Trg IOT and the early years of service. I also met a whole load of my current best mates.

#### What is your best UGSAS story?

There are many from my UAS/ROTC exchange visit to the USA in 1989: including flying in a USAF T37 and T38, visiting the Capitol in Washington DC, the USAF Academy, NORAD and the USAF Museum at Wright Patterson AFB.

#### Do you have any advice for current members?

Take advantage of all that UGSAS offers; from flying, AT, FD and Camaraderie. Youâ€™ll have mates for life.

### Kelly McLennan (1990s)

#### How has UGSAS helped you throughout the years?

Being in UGSAS has made a big impact on my life. Perhaps the biggest one is that it has given me life long friends! Learning from brilliant pilots definitely taught me how to achieve the best from myself. UGSAS also showed me that if you put yourself out there you can achieve amazing things (I got a flight in a Tornado because I put myself in the right place at the right time). My daughter is now in the RAF and has just started a 3 year posting in Cyprus. My involvement in UGSAS has a lot to do with that so it has had an impact on my children and not just me.

#### What is your best UGSAS story?

I am probably not the best person for big stories. I remember lots of little things mostly. Things like the camaraderie in the Squadron really stands out though. For example, one night (of serious Squadron drinking) a few guys wanted to take a car and go on to a club downtown. Without a word - no communication whatsoever - everyone at the bar jumped them at the same time and took their keys. It is amazing what a group of people on the same page can achieve!

Another story - during the 1990 World Cup we were flying out of RNAS Lee-on-Solent on the south coast near Portsmouth. We took over the Officers' Mess for the England - West Germany game and proudly supported the Germans to the severe annoyance of the exclusively English naval officers there. It was the best football game that I have ever watched!

#### Do you have any advice for current members?

I don't think that I need to give Squadron members advice on getting the most out of their time in the Squadron. Everyone there will be smart enough to see that and do it for themselves. Perhaps the most relevant advice is about joining the air force (which I didn't do - I went on to postgraduate research at Oxford). In the Squadron you get to see a lot of the good and a lot of the bad. You will not get that kind of insight about other possible career choices available to you so do not let the bad get in the way too much. It is not as big a part of the picture as it first seems. Every career option probably has the same amount of bad to put up with. So if the RAF lifestyle and demanding expectations appeal to you, and you are the type of person who will enjoy the challenges, then don't overthink the negatives. Even a short commission seems like a long time when you are 20 but you have 48 years of working ahead of you. It isn't long in that context. Whichever path you choose to follow after university, take the best of your UGSAS experience and bring it with you. Encourage and support the people around you and aim for what you want. It isn't always easy but it is always worth it. You do not have to settle for work environments that are awful. It is surprising how even people at the bottom of the ladder can inspire those at the top to make things better. So whatever you get out of UGSAS I hope that it shows you that you can be like Nike and "Just do it!"

### Leon Fisher (2000s)

#### What are you doing now?

Just now I am the Operations Manager for a Veterans Charity in Scotland called Fares4Free. I also set up my own Leadership Consultancy company, Animo et Fide Ltd, after I left the RAF in 2015 which I consult with from time to time.

#### How has UGSAS helped your career?

UGSAS helped my career as I received a Pilot Bursary and joined the RAF in 2004. I was a Chinook Helicopter Pilot and Training Captain and have over 1500 hours in the Chinook. I deployed on 5 tours of duty in Afghanistan in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and I received a Mention In Despatches for a rescue I made on the medical evacuation chinook (callsign Tricky 73) in 2010.

#### What is your best UGSAS story?

My best UGSAS story, I have a few... In the top 3 is when we used to sing Happy Birthday to our then CFI, Mark Faulds, every time we went out for a curry or any UGSAS function outwith THQ. He absolutely hated it as we used to pretend he was 50 (this was when he was in his early 40's ha ha).

#### Do you have any advice for current members?

Seize every opportunity that the Squadron has to offer, and believe in the staff. Please quote me on this... "My Commanding Officer whilst at UGSAS was Wg Cdr Andy Lawless, a true inspiration and absolute hero to all of his students. If it wasn't for him personally, many of us would not have reached our dream of becoming a Commissioned Officer in His Majesty's Royal Air Force. We owe it all to Andy, and the many Commanding Officers who have followed in his footsteps."
