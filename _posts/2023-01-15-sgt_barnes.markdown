In December 2022, UGSAS's GTI - Sgt Dan Barnes - moved onto an exciting new role in RAF Akrotiri. Before he left, our very own OCdt Bruce sat down with Sgt Barnes to talk about his time on the Squadron. Find out about his time on UGSAS, how much he can bench press and why you should "do more stuff"...

#### Where are you going? Why are you leaving?

I'm now going to RAF Akotiri and I'll be doing the Sgt job. Basically instead of doing AT type stuff, I'll be doing gym work with the staff there.

#### How long have you been on UGSAS?

It's coming up for three years - I started on the 6th January 2020. And my posting date in RAF Akrotiri is the 9th January 2023 so it will be three years, three days total.

#### What would you say was your biggest achievement on the Squadron?

The time spent on Ex Kernofornian Dove [an AT expedition to Cornwall]. I think it gave us the opportunity to get to know the students a bit more. Down in Cornwall it was a lot more immersive. I got to know the guys that were on that Ex very well and some of the stuff that I like to do as well. So even though I was broken [due to a knee injury], I was still able to observe what they were doing and use that as a platform to discuss why things happen. I think making that Ex still work with all the challenges that there were was an achievement (because we were under slight COVID restrictions and then we had financial constraints). So I'd say the two one-week serials down in Cornwall is pretty cool. Like I said, I would have liked to do more things like that. I'm pretty gutted in some ways that we've won the Inspire Award because it's something I would have definitely liked to be part of. But it's good that at least I could have helped. This is a fantastic opportunity and is the sort of stuff that I would have liked to have done had things been slightly different with the whole COVID situation.

#### If you were invited to an alumni subcrawl, would you come?

It's a long way, 2000 miles. If I can travel back or if it coincided with anything else, I would definitely come. I definitely want an invite; it's just getting back from Cyprus that isn't the easiest thing to do.

#### Who is your favourite Squadron member?

Who’s my favourite Squadron member? I've not got favourites in that regard. There are people that have done more things from my perspective. I'd say some people are a little bit more proactive in their approach to Squadron life, and so that would probably put them in more favourable light. But I don't think I'm going to pick a favourite.

#### Have you got a favourite staff member?

I don't know - I work here in the office most of the time with the Adj. I don't see the guys at the airport often, so it's difficult. I'm just dodging the question like a politician. I'm not going to get drawn in to favourites!

#### If all Squadron members had a race, where would you place?

Terribly! Well, middle of the pack I'd say - I’m not quick at running. If it was over a marathon I'd probably do alright, probably not as fast as Magnus! If it were swimming I'd do alright at that or mount biking. Depends on what you’re doing. If it were sprinting, I'd not be very good; middle of the pack or worse.

#### How much can you bench press?

130kg is my current load for bench press. More than I can squat with an ACL injury, which is embarrassing!

#### What is your typical gym plan for the week?

This is not indicative of what other people should be doing, but I tend to train 6 days a week, sometimes a couple times a day. This follows a split body routine, that becomes push and pull, or broken into muscle groups. So I'd do back and chest one day, shoulders and arms, then legs. I tend to have one day off in the week and then another lighter day for family things. Now I can do running on a treadmill, go on the bike and do interval sessions. I'm on a walk and run programme coming back from my ACL injury which is the dullest thing in the world, because I'd usually do running programmes like 5km, 10km or interval training (or mirror that on a bike).

I try to do yoga most days because I'm getting old. I'm 40 in a week so my body hurts more and more if I don’t do yoga. Yoga is an amazing thing to keep everything working as it should from a muscular point of view so I would massively advocate doing a stretching and strengthening programme.

I attempt to do high volume training and so multiple working sets on a muscle group. About 20 working sets a week and going from strength all the way into hypertrophy within the same session. Strength exercises would be a much higher load with a lower number of repetitions between three and five, over multiple sets. Hypertrophy would be muscle building with eight to twelve repetitions and less rest. So strength for chest, for example, would be the bench press then I'd look at doing maybe cable flies or incline under pressure dumbbell presses.

#### Do you have a quote to leave us with?

Do more stuff.
