In the latter parts of 2022, UGSAS became the architect of Expedition Glacial Dove, an ambitious plan to tackle the 11th highest peak in the world – Mont Blanc – by winning the RAF’s Inspire award. This is a £15,000 grant towards an adventurous training expedition that would promote and inspire a renewal of personal development and a legacy of AT within the Squadron.

A team effort took place to devise a detailed plan with three students - APO Tait, OCdt McInnes and OCdt Guermarche – initially presenting to OC North in a Dragons' Den style pitch. With OC North in attendance and various esteemed RAF personal dialled in, the initial round of the competition took place.

Following the success of the first stage, work quickly began to fine-tune the details of the pitch. After two weeks of hard work by all the Squadron, the presenters attended the final pitch at RAFC Cranwell, accompanied by Sqn Ldr Melen. With UAS’s in attendance from the length and breadth of the UK, competition for first place was tough. The board in attendance included OC 22 Group, OC 6 FTS among equivalent high ranking civil servants and Warrant Officers. UGSAS was first to deliver a 15-minute presentation on the details of the expedition. This included how risk was going to be mitigated, legacy aspects and how our vision for a low carbon expedition tied into the RAF’s Astra vision. After fielding a range of questions, the waiting began. UGSAS soon found out they were successful, with the Squadron selling the majority of the panel on the vision created. The Squadron now looks forward to bringing this plan to life in the coming months.
