Welcome back to the UGSAS Newsletter - Winter 2023 Edition. It has been a while since the last edition, so we hope you enjoy reading all about what the best UAS has been up to over the last year. I am OCdt O'Neill and I have the daunting task of filling the big shoes of our previous editor-in-chief, who has now moved onto bigger and better things as an APO. I hope that our team can live up to previous expectations, but also put our own new twists into this project.

This edition brings with it a lot of change - first and foremost the online format. We are living up to our motto - _in utrumque paratus_ - moving with the times and adapting to a modern approach. With our own blog, I am sure it is only a matter of time before we are internet famous! We have a whole host of new editors and writers on board this year. It is safe to say that I could not have brought this newsletter to life without their hard work and creativity.

While we may be moving with the times in some respects, it is clear to us that the same core values are fundamental to the Squadron. To include some alumni news in this edition, we were in touch with some famous ex-UGSAS members. Those interviews told stories of ambition, adventure and friendship and we hope to show you in this newsletter that we still have those qualities in abundance on UGSAS...and we have quite a lot of fun along the way!

Thanks to all who support the newsletter - please get in touch with any feedback. Enjoy!
