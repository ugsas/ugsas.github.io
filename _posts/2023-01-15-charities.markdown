On UGSAS, charities form a big part of the work we do. Whether it be through event support by means of helping with marshalling and administration duties, or through actively taking part in the events themselves to show our support, we always strive to achieve maximum engagement and attendance in everything we do.

Over the years UGSAS have supported many different charitable organisations, ranging from local, national, and international organisations. A select few however have become a staple of our annual charitable events calendar, one of the biggest being Erskine. Since their formation in 1916, Erskine have grown to become one of the largest veteran’s support charities in Scotland – caring for over 1,000 veterans each year at one of four care facilities, which includes three care homes and a Veterans Village. In 2022, UGSAS supported Erskine at several events through the year. Starting with their belated Burns night in March, students assisted guests throughout the evening, as well as aided with the running of the night including prize-giving and raffle ticket distribution. Other Erskine events UGSAS aided throughout the year included donation collection at the Ideal home show in May, followed later in the year by providing support at the Golf Day & Military Ball. Erskine’s yearly events finished with the Halloween Walk in late October, in which UGSAS provided marshalling duties along the route. The Squadron hopes to continue to offer support to Erskine, having enjoyed all of last years events.

As well as Erskine, throughout 2022 UGSAS supported several other charities. We started the year participating in the annual Glasgow Kiltwalk in April, with four Squadron members taking part to raise money for the RAF Benevolent Fund. UGSAS also took part in several smaller virtual charitable events held throughout the year such as the 10,000 steps challenge in support of the Scottish air ambulance, with over £100 being raised during the duration of the event. Other virtual events included PTSD awareness month, where for 2022, seven students attempted 22 challenges during the month of June - for example, doing 22 push-ups per day. The Squadron's support for these virtual events showed that UGSAS members are keen to offer support, even on an individual basis.

Towards the end of the year, some of our other key charitable events took place, starting with Movember, where students cycled, walked, or ran over 200km in support of _Move for Movember_, raising £135 in the process. As well as this, several students took part by growing a moustache to show their support. Following on from that, we began our annual Christmas foodbank collection appeal, where UGSAS donated over 300 cans of food to Govan Salvation Army Foodbank, a much-needed donation in a time of year where many people struggle to feed themselves or their families, worsened by the ongoing cost of living crisis.

The UGSAS charitable year was wrapped up in 2022 with the ever popular Santa Dash, where 8 students took part in the annual 5km run through Glasgow Green with the ticket cost going towards the Beatson cancer charity.

In review, our first full year back from COVID restrictions was a successful one for charities on UGSAS. With more people than ever in need of support from the vital charities we have supported, UGSAS hopes that we made an impact and will continue to do so in the future. We look forward to the year ahead, with a renewed passion to support, engage with, and fundraise for those charities that help those who need it the most.
