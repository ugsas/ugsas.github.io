The story that lays before you is a story as old as time, of a curse that has afflicted many aspiring young aviators. Here on UGSAS it has become known as _The Curse of Harvey_, a name that will live on for generations.

After two years of clipped wings as the Squadron got airborne once more, many names became both famous and infamous at the flying element...but one more than any. At Easter, an avid, young aviator from Shrewsbury set foot on Leuchars station for the year's first flying camp, but fly he would not. Many an attempt did he have to get airborne that week but as soon his LSJ was donned the weather would come from beyond. From that week onwards the sight of a blue Toyota flying around the roundabout and over the speedbump into the flying element was a fright. For at once a dreadful realisation would occur to all those inside - only the Yaris would be getting air time that day. He need only glance at a Grob Tutor for the heavens to open, the cloud to descend and the wind to gust. The morning MET brief need only state his presence and at once all know the weather state.

His curse on flying need not stop there as when the curse was kind on the weather it struck elsewhere. One bouncy day after one too many final turns, his face grew greyer than the weather. A graceful pull from his knee pocket later and a full sick bag he clenched, having made quick disposal of the morningâ€™s nutritious pot noodle. Despite all this, he remained as upbeat as a miniature poodle, content he had at least flown but also valuably tested the unit's sick bags. It is claimed he still carries the same now clean sick bag, a lucky charm he hopes, as at least he did fly that day.

With that and a few more lucky charms, he believed his luck had changed. A week later, however, with sick bag, rabbit's foot and four-leaf clover all stowed...the curse returned. As he ascended into clear skies, he should have known the curse was being too kind. In the climb he conducted a full power check but at once noted the RPM was not governing and the CSU was churning. He looked to his left but before he could the expert aviator had taken control and not missed a beat. A PFL later and the tutor was back on the ground. Precautionary fire crews, a DASOR and even making it to Twitter - Harvey thought he was famous and the curse must have lifted.

But the Squadron knows that this is wishful thinking. To this day the sight of a blue Yaris at the flying element remains the best way to predict the weather. It is said the Aldergrove MET office always checks if Harvey is flying before publishing a good forecast.
